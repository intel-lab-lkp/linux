/*
 * SMN accesses may fail in ways that are difficult to detect here in the called
 * functions amd_smn_read() and amd_smn_write(). Therefore, callers must do
 * their own checking based on what behavior they expect.
 *
 * For SMN reads, the returned value may be zero if the register is Read-as-Zero.
 * Or it may be a "PCI Error Response", e.g. all 0xFFs. The "PCI Error Response"
 * can be checked here, and a proper error code can be returned.
 *
 * But the Read-as-Zero response cannot be verified here. A value of 0 may be
 * correct in some cases, so callers must check that this correct is for the
 * register/fields they need.
 *
 * For SMN writes, success can be determined through a "write and read back"
 * However, this is not robust when done here.
 *
 * Possible issues:
 *
 * 1) Bits that are "Write-1-to-Clear". In this case, the read value should
 *    *not* match the write value.
 *
 * 2) Bits that are "Read-as-Zero"/"Writes-Ignored". This information cannot be
 *    known here.
 *
 * 3) Bits that are "Reserved / Set to 1". Ditto above.
 *
 * Callers of amd_smn_write() should do the "write and read back" check
 * themselves, if needed.
 *
 * For #1, they can see if their target bits got cleared.
 *
 * For #2 and #3, they can check if their target bits got set as intended.
 *
 * This matches what is done for RDMSR/WRMSR. As long as there's no #GP, then
 * the operation is considered a success, and the caller does their own
 * checking.
