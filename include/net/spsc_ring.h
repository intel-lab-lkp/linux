 * spsc_ring.h - Lock-free SPSC Ring Buffer with embedded element pool
 *
 * Single-Producer Single-Consumer ring buffer.  The ring owns a
 * contiguous page-backed memory pool.  Each slot is permanently bound
 * to a cacheline-aligned element inside that pool.
 *
 *   Producer calls spsc_produce() -> receives a pointer to a free
 *   element, writes data into it, then calls spsc_produce_commit()
 *   to publish.
 *
 *   Consumer calls spsc_acquire() / spsc_pop() -> receives a pointer
 *   to a filled element.  After spsc_release() the slot becomes
 *   available to the producer again - the element pointer is reused
 *   automatically because it is fixed to the slot.
 *
 * Two consumer modes (do NOT mix on the same instance):
 *
 *   Mode 1 - Sliding window (2-step consumer):
 *     spsc_produce / commit -> peek -> acquire -> release
 *
 *   Mode 2 - Simple queue:
 *     spsc_push -> pop
 *
 * Return convention:
 *   0           success
 *   -ENOSPC     ring full   (producer side)
 *   -ENOENT     ring empty  (consumer side)
 *   -EINVAL     bad parameter
 *   -ENOMEM     allocation failure
 *
 * Memory ordering:
 *   Producer: write data -> smp_store_release(head)
 *   Consumer: smp_load_acquire(head) -> read data
 *   Consumer: done -> smp_store_release(tail)
 *   Producer: smp_load_acquire(tail) -> write data
 *
 * Capacity is always a power of two.
